# TriviaGame
Timed bicycle themed trivia game making use of JavaScript and jQuery

This project is an interactive browser-based game that uses JavaScript timers to limit the time players have to answer the trivia questions. It also uses jQuery to manipulate the DOM.

This project is useful as a tool for learning about setInterval and setTimeout in JavaScript. It is also useful for learning about jQuery and is also a fun and easy to play game.

The project is maintained by Olen Daelhousen
